# Blackout

Ever want to force yourself to wake up early?  Too easy to roll over to your phone and tell it to be quiet?  Or maybe you look at the clock and see that it's safe to sleep in for a bit.

Blackout is meant to solve all of these problems.  Specify a time range and a blackout duration, an and alarm will randomly go off in that time.  But what does that solve?  Not only is the alarm random, the clock is hidden as well, so you can't tell if you're safe sleeping in or not.  You can silence the alarm, but if you try to leave the app before the blackout duration expires, your phone will start calling people in your call history and contacts at random, every 15 seconds, until the duration expires.  And there's nothing you can do to stop it short of turning your phone off.
